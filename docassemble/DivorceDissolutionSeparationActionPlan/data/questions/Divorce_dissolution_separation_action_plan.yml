id: what kind of case
question: |
  Are you interested in divorce or dissolution or legal separation?
subquestion: |
  Most people who want to end their marriage file a divorce or dissolution case, which results in a court order ending the marriage.  
  
  % if minor_children:
  The court generally also enters a parenting plan, a child support order, and an order dividing marital property and debt.
  % else:
  The court generally also enters an order dividing marital property and debt.
  % endif
  
  Some people want to remain legally married to protect significant religious, financial, social, or legal interests (for example, their religion prohibits divorce).
  
  These couples file for legal separation and the court enters an order "legally separating" the spouses.  The court generally also enters 
  % if minor_children:
  a parenting plan, a child support order, and
  % endif
  an order dividing marital property and debt. **This is not a step to a divorce.** It is a separate legal process.  
  
  Either spouse can turn the legal separation into a divorce without the other person's agreement by filing a document with the court.

      The law presumes that a parent with "a history of domestic violence" may not get custody or unsupervised visitation without completing some court-approved treatment. A "history of domestic violence" is defined by law as either one incident of domestic violence that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident. The spouse's domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law. There does not have to be a protective order or criminal case for the court to find a parent has a history of domestic violence. The court can find domestic violence based on one spouse's testimony.

# Each attachment defines a key in an ALDocument. We use `i` as the placeholder here so the same template is 
# used for "preview" and "final" keys, and logic in the template checks the value of
