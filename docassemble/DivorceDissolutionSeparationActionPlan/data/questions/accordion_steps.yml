  Step ${ review_options_idx }: Review your options if a court in another state already ended your marriage
content: |

   <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  Only one state court can end a marriage.  If you and your spouse have an open case to end your marriage in another state, and you file a case in Alaska, one of the courts will close their case. 
  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at:
  
  *	both spouses' "residency" and
  *	which court has the authority, called "jurisdiction", to end the marriage.
  
   <div class="step-subheading">Check if there is residency and jurisdiction in Alaska</div>
  % endif
  There is a residency requirement in Alaska.  Generally, you meet the residency requirement for the court to end your marriage if either 
  % if military:
  you or your spouse are serving in the military and are continuously stationed at a military base in Alaska for at least 30 days, or
  % endif
  you or your spouse are in Alaska and intend to stay as a resident.
  
  % if minor_children:
  To enter a parenting plan, a child support order, or divide marital property and debt, the court also needs authority called “jurisdiction.”
  
  Children: Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."
  
  Spouses: Generally, the court has jurisdiction if a married couple lived in Alaska for at least 6 months in a row within the 6 years before filing for divorce.
  
  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.”  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  Similarly,
  % else:
  To divide marital property and debt, the court also needs authority called “jurisdiction.” Generally, the court has jurisdiction if a married couple lived in Alaska for at least 6 months in a row within the 6 years before filing for divorce.
  
  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated. For example,
  % endif
   if you have property such as a home outside Alaska, the court may not have the authority to enforce any orders about that property if problems arise after the final order.
   
  % if defined('residency_and_jurisdiction') and not residency_and_jurisdiction:
  If the Alaska court has residency and jurisdiction, you can start your case in Alaska, but only one state court can end your marriage.  If you and your spouse disagree about which state, the courts will decide which case to close after hearing both side's arguments.  The decision generally depends on each state's residency and jurisdiction laws.
  <div class="step-subheading">To start a case in Alaska: file a complaint in Alaska and ask the court in the other state to close its case</div>
  **Fill out and file a complaint**
  Fill out and file a Complaint form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce.
  If you need information about filling out and filing a Complaint, return to the Guided Assist page and start over.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  
  **Ask the other state to close its case**
  You will have to ask the court in the other state to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the Internet to learn about that state's self-help resources and forms.
  **What to expect if you start a case in Alaska**
  Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case.  When this happens, one state court may close its case.
  If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward. 
  It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
  Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.
  % else:
  
  If your spouse has never been to Alaska or no longer lives in Alaska, it is possible he or she will ask the court to dismiss the case.  If the court finds it does not have jurisdiction, it might dismiss your case.  If you have any questions about whether Alaska is the right place for your case, you may want to talk to a lawyer. Review the options below to get more information or help.

content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">The benefits of reaching an agreement</div>
  If you and your spouse reach an agreement about the issues in the case, you can avoid a trial.  Some benefits are:
  
  * You decide the outcome rather than a judge - you know more about the issues in your case than the judge ever will.
  % if minor_children:
  * If you have children together, working out the parenting plan instead of fighting is better for the children.
  % endif
  * Reaching an agreement may be more cooperative than dealing with the issues in a trial, where each spouse presents evidence and makes arguments about what they want the judge to decide.
  *	Reaching an agreement outside of court can save time and money, and provide more privacy and confidentiality.
  
  If you want help reaching an agreement before the case is open, some options are:
  
  *  Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial.
  *  Mediation.
  *  Collaborative Law.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial</div>
  Some couples want to work out the issues by agreement without a trial and are able to talk to each other in person, on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.  You can use the uncontested divorce forms in the next section of this Action Plan to see what you need to agree on.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  Mediation is an informal, voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  *	Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  *	Explain and understand each other's needs.
  *	Clear up misunderstandings.

  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to a lawyer</div>
  It is a good idea to get legal advice by talking to an attorney about an agreement. Both spouses need to understand how agreeing to each issue affects the other issues in the agreement. If you agree to something without thinking it through, there can be serious and long-standing consequences. Once a judge signs off on your agreement, it will be a binding court order that outlines each spouses’ responsibilities and rights regarding the issues in the case.

content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Very short marriage</div>
  Short marriages often result in each spouse keeping their own possessions and debts as if they had never gotten married.  This is common with marriages of 2 years or less if the couple did not buy a house together or save any significant money.  However, sometimes even in short marriages the spouses have bought expensive items like a home or taken on a lot of debt that needs to be divided.
  <div class="step-subheading">Very long separation</div>
   Sometimes spouses have been separated many months or years and have divided all their property and money; paid or split up debt; taken each other’s names off bank accounts, credit cards, utilities, titles, etc.; and sold large joint property like houses.  If the division was fair, these couples may not need to divide anything else.

template: do_not_have_common_step
subject: |
  Step ${ do_not_have_common_idx }: Make sure you do not have marital assets and debts to divide
content: |
  When people get a divorce, the court signs an order dividing all the marital property.  Marital property is anything earned or bought during the marriage.  This commonly includes houses, land, vehicles, money, retirement accounts, pensions, household goods, furniture, snowmachines, four-wheelers and each spouse’s personal property. 

  Generally, the following are not considered marital property so the court will not divide them, unless one spouse did something that changed the separate property to marital:
  
  * Inheritance,
  *	Gifts to one spouse (engagement ring),
  *	Premarital assets,
  *	Property acquired during marriage solely from separate sources,
  *	Social Security benefits,
  *	Military disability payments, and
  *	Post-separation credit card debt that is not marital debt because one spouse had no other way to support him or herself.

  JS deleted 2024-04-21
    * A dissolution and an uncontested divorce have the same result.  Both end the marriage based on your agreement without a trial.  You start a dissolution with a form called a "Petition" and pick one spouse to be "Party A" and the other to be "Party B."  You start an uncontested divorce with a "Complaint" and pick one spouse to be "Plaintiff" and the other to be "Defendant."  There is no difference in the case if you are Party A, Party B, Plaintiff, or Defendant.
  * The uncontested divorce forms have choices not in the dissolution forms, such as a box to check if there is no marital property or debt to divide.  If you need one of these choices, you will only get the uncontested divorce forms below.  If not, you will be given information on both sets of forms and can choose which to use.

  Some courts allow a divorce case to move forward when the wife is pregnant.   Other courts require that the child be born before completing the case. 

  You can file a motion asking the court to divorce you before the child is born, and deal with the parenting plan and child support after. There is no guarantee the judge will grant your motion. The decision depends on whether delaying your divorce until after the child is born will harm one of the spouses.  To ask the court, you can file:

  * If both parents agree: **Joint Motion, Affidavit & Order to Bifurcate Divorce for Custody, SHC-155 [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-155.docx)** | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-155n.pdf) (Do **not** sign the order section)

  % else:
  If a wife is pregnant when a marriage ends the law considers the husband to be the father.  If the husband is not the father, the court can remove the husband’s rights and responsibilities for that child.  This is called “disestablishing paternity.”

  You usually cannot disestablish paternity before a child is born. You can file a motion asking the court to divorce you and deal with paternity after the child is born.

  * If both parents agree: **Joint Motion, Affidavit and Order to Bifurcate Divorce for Subsequent Determination of Paternity, SHC-153 [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-153.docx)** | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-153n.pdf) (Do **not** sign the order section)

  If a parent thinks the husband is not the biological or adopted father of a child born during the marriage, that parent can ask the court to remove the husband’s rights and responsibilities for that child. This is called “disestablishing paternity.”  You need clear and convincing evidence. There are different ways to do this depending on the facts of the situation. Every case is different so you need to figure out what will work in your case. Some options are:
    * All of the people involved in the case sign an affidavit, the **Three-Way Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf). This can be filled out by:

    * the mother, the husband, and the man who is the father stating the husband is NOT the father and that the man is the biological father
    * the mother and the husband saying the husband is NOT the father to disestablish the husband as the biological father
    * the mother and the man saying he IS the father to establish him as the biological father
    * the mother only if others are not cooperating and she can provide convincing facts about the paternity
  * Get genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother, the man believed to be the father, and the husband if the mother is married. The test results must be provided to the court. This can be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file:

    * **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370 [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc)** | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  You have to give your spouse copies of everything you file in court plus the Summons. This is called “service.” There are special requirements about how to serve your spouse the forms that start the case.

  Choose how you want to serve the forms that start the case. You cannot serve these forms by hand delivery or 1st class mail, but you can serve later documents by these methods:

    * Certified Mail/Restricted Delivery/Return Receipt, or
    * Hiring a Process Server.
  <div class="step-subheading">Certified Mail (less expensive – less than $10)</div>

    * Make sure you pay for certified mail, restricted delivery, and return receipt so that only your spouse can sign for the mail and sends the green card back to you after signing it.
    * Save the green card in case you need to show you served your spouse.

  Read how to prepare the envelope and the certified mail postal forms in: How to Serve a Summons, [CIV-106](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-106.pdf).
  <div class="step-subheading">Process Server: (more expensive – up to $65 in Alaska – but may be best if your spouse refused to sign for certified mail)</div>

    * Choose a process server and pay for their services. Find a statewide list of authorized process servers. For process servers outside of Alaska, contact the local court where the opposing party lives, or do internet research.
    * Fill out the form Service Instructions, CIV-615. Give this form to the process server so that when he or she completes service, you will receive a Proof of Service form.
    * If you are hiring a process service outside of Alaska, give them the Return of Service, SHC-194 Word | PDF. They will send it back to you after serving the Summons and Complaint.
    * Save the Proof of Service or Return of Service form in case you need to show you served your spouse.
    * You can read more about serving with a process server in: How to Serve a Summons, [CIV-106](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-106.pdf).

  <div class="step-subheading">Options if regular service does not work</div>
  <strong>Alternate Service</strong>
  If you cannot find your spouse, you may ask the court for permission to serve your spouse in a different way. For example, you can ask to post on the court’s legal notice website, post to someone’s social media account, email, publish in a newspaper that your spouse reads or post at a shelter or some other location your spouse is known to frequent. Read more on the court's web page,  [Instructions for Alternate Service](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shc-184.htm).

  <strong>Special situations</strong>
  Read the court's web page that has information about [special situations](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/serve.htm#11) like serving someone in a foreign country, the military or jail.

  After the notice has been posted 4 weeks, fill out and file the **Proof of Notice**, [DR-225](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-225.pdf). When you file your **Proof of Notice**, ask the clerk's office for instructions on setting a hearing date. The hearing must be at least 30 days after the end of the 4 weeks the notice was posted on the court's website.

  Attend the hearing.  The court will ask you questions about trying to find your spouse and about ending the marriage.

  Step ${ paternity_testing_idx }: 
    Learn about paternity testing
content: |
 <div class="step-subheading">General paternity information</div>

  Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are.  Once established, the father's name can be placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's biological father.  

  Courts use genetic testing, more commonly called "DNA testing," to establish or disestablish paternity.  To take the test, a DNA sample is collected using a swab, similar to a Q-Tip, inside the cheek to pick up cells.  Samples are collected from the mother, the child, and the person who may be the father.  The testing is painless and the whole process takes about 15 minutes.  Once all the samples have been collected, the result is ready within about 3 weeks.

  <div class="step-subheading">If you are unsure, you can ask for a paternity test</div>

  * **In Court**: Once you open a case to end your marriage, you can file:

  **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  **Order for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1375** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375n.pdf)

  The court will decide where the test is done (usually CSED) and who will pay.

  * **Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED)**: Before you open a case, you can ask CSED to establish or disestablish paternity.

  Either the mother or the father may complete an application for CSED services (if there isn't already an open CSED case) and a paternity affidavit.

  If the father isn't willing to sign a voluntary affidavit, CSED may order DNA testing to prove fatherhood.  If CSED orders the test, the State will pay the costs for the mother, the child and the man named as the father. If the father is identified by the tests, he will be asked to reimburse the State for the costs. If the man is not the father, he will not have to pay for the tests. If either the mother or the father challenges the original test results, he or she may pay for a second test.

  If the father lives outside Alaska, CSED can ask the other state to help establish paternity.

  Sometimes CSED may decide it cannot do a DNA test based on the specific situation and tell you to file a paternity case in court.

  CSED charges about $51 per person taking the test.

  See [CSED's FAQs about paternity](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/FAQ/FAQ_Paternity.aspx) and [contact CSED](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/contacts.aspx) for the appropriate forms.

  <div class="step-subheading">Private Labs</div>

  You can hire a private lab to do DNA testing.

  They are usually more expensive.  You and your spouse will have to work out who pays.

  The court does not accept do-it-yourself DNA tests as evidence.

  <div class="step-subheading">Change the Birth Certificate</div>

  * If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate.  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered "legitimated" and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.

  People who have experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they separate from their spouse or start a court case to end the marriage.  During this time, safety is very important.  The dynamics in a relationship with domestic violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they do not want.  If this is your situation, these resources may help:
  
  *	Find a domestic violence program in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with court).
  *	You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find ""Protective Orders.”

  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children, you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children’s best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.

  <div class="step-subheading">Tell the judge your concerns</div>

  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court.  If you have concerns for the children’s safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge.  If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns.  Some options include:
  
  *	no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
  * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
  *	no overnight visitation,
  *	no excessive discipline or spanking,
  *	no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
  *	no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
  *	no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
  *	exchanges only at public or specified places,
  *	supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
  *	parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
  *	supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
  *	no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-150](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-150.pdf) to the other parent:
