  There are 3 options for where a military member or spouse can file a divorce case:
    
    * The state where the military member or spouse is stationed. If you or your spouse are serving in the military and are continuously stationed at a military base in Alaska for at least 30 days, you can file for a divorce.
    * The state where the spouse is a resident. When filing for divorce or dissolution in Alaska, the spouse is generally an Alaska resident if the spouse is in Alaska and plans to stay.
    * The state where the military member claims legal residency (place where military member plans to live after discharge or retirement).

  Although either spouse may file for divorce in any of these locations, the court may not have the authority, called "jurisdiction," to take other actions. If the court cannot take other actions, the court may also decide not to grant your divorce.

  You may file to end your marriage in Alaska as long as you or your spouse is an Alaska resident. When filing for divorce or dissolution, you are generally an Alaska resident if you are in Alaska and plan to stay.

  If you or your spouse meets this residency requirement, an Alaska court generally can grant you a divorce and end your marriage.  But if your spouse does not live in Alaska, the court may not have the authority, called "jurisdiction", to take other actions.
  
  If the court cannot take other actions, the court may also decide not to grant your divorce.

  <div class="step-subheading">The benefits of reaching an agreement</div>
  If you and your spouse reach an agreement about the issues in the case, you can avoid a trial.  Some benefits are:
  
  * You decide the outcome rather than a judge - you know more about the issues in your case than the judge ever will.
  % if minor_children:
  * If you have children together, working out the parenting plan instead of fighting is better for the children.
  % endif
  * Reaching an agreement may be more cooperative than dealing with the issues in a trial, where each spouse presents evidence and makes arguments about what they want the judge to decide.
  *	Reaching an agreement outside of court can save time and money, and provide more privacy and confidentiality.
  
  If you want help reaching an agreement before the case is open, some options are:
  
  *  Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial.
  *  Mediation.
  *  Collaborative Law.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial</div>
  Some couples want to work out the issues by agreement without a trial and are able to talk to each other in person, on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.  You can use the uncontested divorce forms in the next section of this Action Plan to see what you need to agree on.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  Mediation is an informal, voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  *	Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  *	Explain and understand each other's needs.
  *	Clear up misunderstandings.
  *	Explore creative solutions.
  *	Reach acceptable agreements.
  
   Spouses can hire their own private mediators to help resolve any issue in the case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your marriage, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence, and tell your mediator if you want to bring a trusted support person with you.  
  
  [Read about mediation](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/mediation/index.htm).

  Watch [a short video that discusses resolving your case](https://youtu.be/4EuW9HET3nM) by reaching agreement with your spouse.  It discusses mediation and settlement conferences which may be available to you using free court programs once you file your case.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to a lawyer</div>
  It is a good idea to get legal advice by talking to an attorney about an agreement. Both spouses need to understand how agreeing to each issue affects the other issues in the agreement. If you agree to something without thinking it through, there can be serious and long-standing consequences. Once a judge signs off on your agreement, it will be a binding court order that outlines each spouses' responsibilities and rights regarding the issues in the case.

content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Very short marriage</div>
  Short marriages often result in each spouse keeping their own possessions and debts as if they had never gotten married.  This is common with marriages of 2 years or less if the couple did not buy a house together or save any significant money.  However, sometimes even in short marriages the spouses have bought expensive items like a home or taken on a lot of debt that needs to be divided.
  <div class="step-subheading">Very long separation</div>
   Sometimes spouses have been separated many months or years and have divided all their property and money; paid or split up debt; taken each other's names off bank accounts, credit cards, utilities, titles, etc.; and sold large joint property like houses.  If the division was fair, these couples may not need to divide anything else.

template: do_not_have_common_step
subject: |
  Step ${ do_not_have_common_idx }: Make sure you do not have marital assets and debts to divide
content: |
  When people get a divorce, the court signs an order dividing all the marital property.  Marital property is anything earned or bought during the marriage.  This commonly includes houses, land, vehicles, money, retirement accounts, pensions, household goods, furniture, snowmachines, four-wheelers and each spouse's personal property. 

  Generally, the following are not considered marital property so the court will not divide them, unless one spouse did something that changed the separate property to marital:
  
  * Inheritance,
  *	Gifts to one spouse (engagement ring),
  *	Premarital assets,
  *	Property acquired during marriage solely from separate sources,
  *	Social Security benefits,
  *	Military disability payments, and
  *	Post-separation credit card debt that is not marital debt because one spouse had no other way to support him or herself.

  JS deleted 2024-04-21
    * A dissolution and an uncontested divorce have the same result.  Both end the marriage based on your agreement without a trial.  You start a dissolution with a form called a "Petition" and pick one spouse to be "Party A" and the other to be "Party B."  You start an uncontested divorce with a "Complaint" and pick one spouse to be "Plaintiff" and the other to be "Defendant."  There is no difference in the case if you are Party A, Party B, Plaintiff, or Defendant.
  * The uncontested divorce forms have choices not in the dissolution forms, such as a box to check if there is no marital property or debt to divide.  If you need one of these choices, you will only get the uncontested divorce forms below.  If not, you will be given information on both sets of forms and can choose which to use.

  Some judges allow a divorce case to move forward when the wife is pregnant. Other judges require that the child be born before completing the case.  
  
  You can ask the court to divorce you before the child is born, and deal with the parenting plan and child support after. There is no guarantee the judge will grant your motion. The decision depends on whether delaying your divorce until after the child is born will harm one of the spouses. 
  
  To ask the court to allow your divorce to move forward, you can file:

  If a parent thinks the husband is not the biological or adopted father of a child born during the marriage, that parent can ask the court to remove the husband's rights and responsibilities for that child. This is called "disestablishing paternity."  You need clear and convincing evidence. There are different ways to do this depending on the facts of the situation. Every case is different so you need to figure out what will work in your case. Some options are:
    * All of the people involved in the case sign an affidavit, the **Three-Way Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf). This can be filled out by:

    * The mother, the husband, and the man who is the father stating the husband is **not** the father and that the man is the biological father.
    * The mother and the husband saying the husband is NOT the father to disestablish the husband as the biological father.
    * The mother and the man saying he IS the father to establish him as the biological father
    * The mother only if others are not cooperating and she can provide convincing facts about the paternity.
  * Get genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother, the man believed to be the father, and the husband. The test results must be provided to the court. This can be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file:

    * **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370 [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc)** | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  If a wife is pregnant when spouses become legally separated, the law considers the husband to be the father.  
  
  If the husband is not the father, the court can remove the husband's rights and responsibilities for that child.  This is called "disestablishing paternity."
  
  You usually cannot disestablish paternity before a child is born. You can file a motion that asks the court to legally separate you and deal with paternity after the child is born. There is no guarantee the judge will grant your motion. The decision depends on if delaying your legal separation until after the child is born will harm one of the spouses.
  
  To ask the judge to go ahead with your legal separation case before the child is born, you can file:

  * If both parents agree:  
  * **Joint Motion, Affidavit & Order to Bifurcate Legal Separation for Subsequent Determination of Paternity, SHC-153a**,
  Call the [Family Law Self-Help Center](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcabout.htm#1c) for this form

  If a parent thinks the husband is not the biological or adopted father of a child born during the marriage, that parent can ask the court to remove the husband's rights and responsibilities for that child.   This is called "disestablishing paternity."  You need clear and convincing evidence. There are different ways to do this depending on the facts of the situation. Every case is different so you need to figure out what will work in your case. Some options are:

    * All of the people involved in the case sign affidavits: **Three-Way Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151** 
    as a [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc) file
    as a [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf)
      
  * This can be filled out by:
    * the mother, the husband and the man who is the father stating the husband is **not** the father and that the man is the biological father
    * the mother and the husband saying the husband is **not** the father to disestablish the husband as the biological father 
    * the mother and the man saying he IS the father to establish him as the biological father 
    * the mother only if others are not cooperating and she can provide convincing facts about the paternity 
  * Get genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother, the man believed to be the father, and the husband. The test results must be provided to the court. This cannot be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file: 
  * **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370**
  as a [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc) file
  as a [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

 <div class="step-subheading">General paternity information</div>

  Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are.  Once established, the father's name can be placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's biological father.  

  Courts use genetic testing, more commonly called "DNA testing," to establish or disestablish paternity.  To take the test, a DNA sample is collected using a swab, similar to a Q-Tip, inside the cheek to pick up cells.  Samples are collected from the mother, the child, and the person who may be the father.  The testing is painless and the whole process takes about 15 minutes.  Once all the samples have been collected, the result is ready within about 3 weeks.

  <div class="step-subheading">If you are unsure, you can ask for a paternity test</div>

  * **In Court**: Once you open a case to end your marriage, you can file:

  **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  **Order for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1375** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375n.pdf)

  The court will decide where the test is done (usually CSED) and who will pay.

  * **Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED)**: Before you open a case, you can ask CSED to establish or disestablish paternity.

  Either the mother or the father may complete an application for CSED services (if there isn't already an open CSED case) and a paternity affidavit.

  If the father isn't willing to sign a voluntary affidavit, CSED may order DNA testing to prove fatherhood.  If CSED orders the test, the State will pay the costs for the mother, the child and the man named as the father. If the father is identified by the tests, he will be asked to reimburse the State for the costs. If the man is not the father, he will not have to pay for the tests. If either the mother or the father challenges the original test results, he or she may pay for a second test.

  If the father lives outside Alaska, CSED can ask the other state to help establish paternity.

  Sometimes CSED may decide it cannot do a DNA test based on the specific situation and tell you to file a paternity case in court.

  CSED charges about $51 per person taking the test.

  See [CSED's FAQs about paternity](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/FAQ/FAQ_Paternity.aspx) and [contact CSED](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/contacts.aspx) for the appropriate forms.

  <div class="step-subheading">Private Labs</div>

  You can hire a private lab to do DNA testing.

  They are usually more expensive.  You and your spouse will have to work out who pays.

  The court does not accept do-it-yourself DNA tests as evidence.

  <div class="step-subheading">Change the Birth Certificate</div>

  * If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate.  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered "legitimated" and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.

  People who have experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they separate from their spouse or start a court case to end the marriage.  During this time, safety is very important.  The dynamics in a relationship with domestic violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they do not want.  If this is your situation, these resources may help:
  
  *	Find a domestic violence program in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with court).
  *	You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find "Protective Orders."

      * if the domestic violence does make a spouse uncomfortable or afraid, provisions are used to make the process of trying to reach an agreement feel safer (having a support person present, having a mediator or a trusted third person help with discussions, not meeting in-person, meeting in different rooms, or talking about an agreement through email, text or telephone);
      * one spouse's main goal is to finish the case and be done in a safe manner so they are willing to give up some things in the agreement that they may be entitled to under the law.
  
  You can decide whether you are comfortable trying to reach an agreement with your spouse based on the facts and circumstances of your case.

  % endif
  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children, you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children's best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer's intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.
  % if agree_or_settle_kids == 'no':
  <div class="step-subheading">Tell the judge your concerns</div>
  % endif
  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court.  If you have concerns for the children's safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge.  If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns.  Some options include:
  
  *	no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
  * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
  *	no overnight visitation,
  *	no excessive discipline or spanking,
  *	no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
  *	no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
  *	no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
  *	exchanges only at public or specified places,
  *	supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
  *	parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
  *	supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
  *	no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-150](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-150.pdf) to the other parent:
  
  *	do not give the other parent a copy of the completed **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit** after you file it with the court, and
  *	file **Direction to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-151](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-151.pdf).
