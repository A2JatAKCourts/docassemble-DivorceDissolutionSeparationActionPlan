   <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  Only one state court can end a marriage.  If you and your spouse have an open case to end your marriage in another state, and you file a case in Alaska, one of the courts will close their case. 
  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at:
  
  *	both spouses' "residency" and
  *	which court has the authority, called "jurisdiction", to end the marriage.
  
   <div class="step-subheading">Check if there is residency and jurisdiction in Alaska</div>

  you or your spouse are serving in the military and are continuously stationed at a military base in Alaska for at least 30 days, or
  % endif
  you or your spouse are in Alaska and intend to stay as a resident.
  
  % if minor_children:
  To enter a parenting plan, a child support order, or divide marital property and debt, the court also needs authority called “jurisdiction.”
  Children: Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."
  Spouses: Generally, the court has jurisdiction if a married couple lived in Alaska for at least 6 months in a row within the 6 years before filing for divorce.
  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.”  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  Similarly,

   if you have property such as a home outside Alaska, the court may not have the authority to enforce any orders about that property if problems arise after the final order.
   
  % if defined('residency_and_jurisdiction') and not residency_and_jurisdiction:
  If the Alaska court has residency and jurisdiction, you can start your case in Alaska, but only one state court can end your marriage.  If you and your spouse disagree about which state, the courts will decide which case to close after hearing both side's arguments.  The decision generally depends on each state's residency and jurisdiction laws.
  <div class="step-subheading">To start a case in Alaska: file a complaint in Alaska and ask the court in the other state to close its case</div>
  **Fill out and file a complaint**
  Fill out and file a Complaint form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce.
  If you need information about filling out and filing a Complaint, return to the Guided Assist page and start over.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  
  **Ask the other state to close its case**
  You will have to ask the court in the other stateto close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the Internet to learn about that state's self-help resources and forms.
  **What to expect if you start a case in Alaska**
  Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case.  When this happens, one state court may close its case.
  If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward. 
  It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
  Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.
  % else:
  
  If your spouse has never been to Alaska or no longer lives in Alaska, it is possible he or she will ask the court to dismiss the case.  If the court finds it does not have jurisdiction, it might dismiss your case.  If you have any questions about whether Alaska is the right place for your case, you may want to talk to a lawyer.

  <div class="step-subheading">The benefits of reaching an agreement</div>
  If you and your spouse reach an agreement about the issues in the case, you can avoid a trial.  Some benefits are:
  
  * You decide the outcome rather than a judge - you know more about the issues in your case than the judge ever will.
  % if minor_children:
  * If you have children together, working out the parenting plan instead of fighting is better for the children.
  % endif
  * Reaching an agreement may be more cooperative than dealing with the issues in a trial, where each spouse presents evidence and makes arguments about what they want the judge to decide.
  *	Reaching an agreement outside of court can save time and money, and provide more privacy and confidentiality.
  
  If you want help reaching an agreement before the case is open, some options are:
  
  *  Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial.
  *  Mediation.
  *  Collaborative Law.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial</div>
  Some couples want to work out the issues by agreement without a trial and are able to talk to each other in person, on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.  You can use the dissolution and uncontested divorce forms in the next section of this Action Plan to see what you need agree on.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  Mediation is an informal, voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  *	Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  *	Explain and understand each other's needs.
  *	Clear up misunderstandings.
  *	Explore creative solutions.
  *	Reach acceptable agreements.
  
   Spouses can hire their own private mediators to help resolve any issue in the case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your marriage, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence, and tell your mediator if you want to bring a trusted support person with you.  [Read about mediation](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/mediation/index.htm).
   
  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  The [Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals](https://www.alaskacollaborative.org/) helps people resolve divorce cases outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Watch a video</div>
  Watch [a short video that discusses resolving your case](https://youtu.be/4EuW9HET3nM) by reaching agreement with your spouse.  It discusses mediation and settlement conferences which may be available to you using free court programs once you file your case.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to a lawyer</div>
  It is a good idea to get legal advice by talking to an attorney about an agreement. Both spouses need to understand how agreeing to each issue affects the other issues in the agreement. If you agree to something without thinking it through, there can be serious and long-standing consequences. Once a judge signs off on your agreement, it will be a binding court order that outlines each spouses’ responsibilities and rights regarding the issues in the case.

  Usually when you start a case you must give your spouse every form you file with the court.  This is called “service.” If you do not know where your spouse is, you can ask the court to let you use “alternate service,” which is described below.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">After you start your case by filing a complaint  and other documents, and cannot serve your spouse, ask the court to let you use alternate service</div>
  
  * Read: [Tips on Locating People](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shctips.htm).
  *	Review and fill out the **Request to Serve Defendant by Posting or Alternative Service, and Affidavit of Diligent Inquiry**, [CIV-145](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-145.pdf) (this form tells you the things you must do to try to find your spouse before asking for alternate service).
  * Make 1 copy of the form and any attachments.
  *	File the original documents at your local court. Keep one copy for your records.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Final Steps</div>
  
  * Now you wait. The clerk will sign the Notice to Absent Spouse if the court finds you did enough to try to serve your spouse. The court will then post the notice on the Alaska Court System's legal notice website for 4 weeks in a row.
  * Before the last week of posting, you must send a copy of the Notice and the Complaint by regular first class mail and registered or certified mail to your spouse at your spouse's last known residence or workplace. However, if you have already tried to serve your spouse by certified mail, then before the last week of posting, just send by regular first class mail.  File:
    
    * Affidavit, SHC-1625 Word | PDF (1 week before posting ends that states you):
    
      * tried to serve your spouse by regular first class mail and registered or certified mail **or**
      *	could **not** serve by mail because you cannot find your spouse's last known mailing address
      
    *	After the Notice has been posted on the legal notice website for 4 weeks, the clerk will complete a certificate of service of posting to the Alaska Court System’s legal notice website. The court will put the certificate of service of posting in your case file and send you a copy in the mail.

  Short marriages often result in each spouse keeping their own possessions and debts as if they had never gotten married.  This is common with marriages of 2 years or less if the couple did not buy a house together or save any significant money.  However, sometimes even in short marriages the spouses have bought expensive items like a home or taken on a lot of debt that needs to be divided.

   Sometimes spouses have been separated many months or years and have divided all their property and money; paid or split up debt; taken each other’s names off bank accounts, credit cards, utilities, titles, etc.; and sold large joint property like houses.  If the division was fair, these couples may not need to divide anything else.

  Step ${ do_not_have_common_idx }: Make sure you do not have marital assets and debts to divide
content: |
  When people get a divorce, the court signs an order dividing all the marital property.  Marital property is anything earned or bought during the marriage.  This commonly includes houses, land, vehicles, money, retirement accounts, pensions, household goods, furniture, snowmachines, four-wheelers and each spouse’s personal property. 

  Generally, the following are not considered marital property so the court will not divide them, unless one spouse did something that changed the separate property to marital:
  
  * Inheritance,
  *	Gifts to one spouse (engagement ring),
  *	Premarital assets,
  *	Property acquired during marriage solely from separate sources,
  *	Social Security benefits,
  *	Military disability payments, and
  *	Post-separation credit card debt that is not marital debt because one spouse had no other way to support him or herself.

  If you are unsure whether or not you have marital property and debt to divide, you can answer more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  Then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find "Dividing Property and Debt in a Divorce."

You start an uncontested divorce with a "Complaint" and pick one spouse to be "Plaintiff" and the other to be "Defendant."  There is no difference in the case if you are Party A, Party B, Plaintiff, or Defendant.

  If a parent thinks the husband is not the biological or adopted father of a child born during the marriage, that parent can ask the court to remove the husband’s rights and responsibilities for that child. This is called “disestablishing paternity.”  You need clear and convincing evidence. There are different ways to do this depending on the facts of the situation. Every case is different so you need to figure out what will work in your case. Some options are:
    * All of the people involved in the case sign affidavits: **Three-Way Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151** ([Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf)). This can be filled out by:

    * the mother, the husband, and the man who is the father stating the husband is NOT the father and that the man is the biological father
    * the mother and the husband saying the husband is NOT the father to disestablish the husband as the biological father
    * the mother and the man saying he IS the father to establish him as the biological father
    * the mother only if others are not cooperating and she can provide convincing facts about the paternity
  * Get genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother, the man believed to be the father, and the husband if the mother is married. The test results must be provided to the court. This can be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file:

    * **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370 [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc)** | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  If a parent thinks the husband is not the biological or adopted father of a child born during the marriage, that parent can ask the court to remove the husband’s rights and responsibilities for that child.   This is called “disestablishing paternity.”  You need clear and convincing evidence. There are different ways to do this depending on the facts of the situation. Every case is different so you need to figure out what will work in your case. Some options are:

  * This can be filled out by:
    * the mother, the husband and the man who is the father stating the husband is **not** the father and that the man is the biological father
    * the mother and the husband saying the husband is **not** the father to disestablish the husband as the biological father 
    * the mother and the man saying he IS the father to establish him as the biological father 
    * the mother only if others are not cooperating and she can provide convincing facts about the paternity 
  * Get genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother, the man believed to be the father, and the husband if the mother is married. The test results must be provided to the court. This cannot be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file: 
  * **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370**
  as a [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc) file

  Choose how you want to serve the forms that start the case (you cannot serve these forms by hand delivery or 1st class mail, but you can serve later documents by these methods):
  
  * Certified Mail/Restricted Delivery/Return Receipt, **or**
  * Hiring a Process Server.

  * Fill out the form **Service Instructions**, [CIV-615](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-106.pdf).  Give this form to the process server so that when he or she completes service, you will receive a Proof of Service form.

 <div class="step-subheading">General paternity information</div>

  Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are.  Once established, the father's name can be placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's biological father.  

  Courts use genetic testing, more commonly called "DNA testing," to establish or disestablish paternity.  To take the test, a DNA sample is collected using a swab, similar to a Q-Tip, inside the cheek to pick up cells.  Samples are collected from the mother, the child, and the person who may be the father.  The testing is painless and the whole process takes about 15 minutes.  Once all the samples have been collected, the result is ready within about 3 weeks.

  <div class="step-subheading">If you are unsure, you can ask for a paternity test</div>

  * **In Court**: Once you open a case to end your marriage, you can file:

  **Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf)

  **Order for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1375** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375n.pdf)

  The court will decide where the test is done (usually CSSD) and who will pay.

  * **Child Support Services Division (CSSD)**: Before you open a case, you can ask CSSD to establish or disestablish paternity.

  Either the mother or the father may complete an application for CSSD services (if there isn't already an open CSSD case) and a paternity affidavit.

  If the father isn't willing to sign a voluntary affidavit, CSSD may order DNA testing to prove fatherhood.  If CSSD orders the test, the State will pay the costs for the mother, the child and the man named as the father. If the father is identified by the tests, he will be asked to reimburse the State for the costs. If the man is not the father, he will not have to pay for the tests. If either the mother or the father challenges the original test results, he or she may pay for a second test.

  If the father lives outside Alaska, CSSD can ask the other state to help establish paternity.

  Sometimes CSSD may decide it cannot do a DNA test based on the specific situation and tell you to file a paternity case in court.

  CSSD charges about $51 per person taking the test.

  See [CSSD's FAQs about paternity](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/FAQ/FAQ_Paternity.aspx) and [contact CSSD](http://www.childsupport.alaska.gov/contacts.aspx) for the appropriate forms.

  <div class="step-subheading">Private Labs</div>

  You can hire a private lab to do DNA testing.

  They are usually more expensive.  You and your spouse will have to work out who pays.

  The court does not accept do-it-yourself DNA tests as evidence.

  <div class="step-subheading">Change the Birth Certificate</div>

  * If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate.  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered "legitimated" and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics & Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.

  If you are in immediate danger, call 911.

  People who have experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they separate from their spouse or start a court case to end the marriage.  During this time, safety is very important.  The dynamics in a relationship with domestic violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they do not want.  If this is your situation, these resources may help:
  
  *	Find a domestic violence program in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with court).
  *	You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find ""Protective Orders.”

  However, some people in a marriage with domestic violence are comfortable reaching an agreement about dividing marital property and debt for a variety of reasons. Sometimes:
  
      * the domestic violence does not make either spouse uncomfortable or afraid to ask for what they want in the property & debt division;
      * if the domestic violence does make a spouse uncomfortable or afraid, provisions are used to make the process of trying to reach an agreement feel safer (having a support person present, having a mediator or a trusted third person help with discussions, not meeting in-person, meeting in different rooms, or talking about an agreement through email, text or telephone);
      * one spouse’s main goal is to finish the case and be done in a safe manner so they are willing to give up some things in the agreement that they may be entitled to under the law.
  
  You can decide whether you are comfortable trying to reach an agreement with your spouse based on the facts and circumstances of your case.

  % endif
  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children, you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children’s best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.
  % if agree_or_settle_kids == 'no':
  <div class="step-subheading">Tell the judge your concerns</div>
  % endif
  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court.  If you have concerns for the children’s safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge.  If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns.  Some options include:
  
  *	no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
  * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
  *	no overnight visitation,
  *	no excessive discipline or spanking,
  *	no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
  *	no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
  *	no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
  *	exchanges only at public or specified places,
  *	supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
  *	parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
  *	supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
  *	no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-150](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-150.pdf) to the other parent:
  
  *	do not give the other parent a copy of the completed **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit** after you file it with the court, and
  *	file **Direction to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-151](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-151.pdf).
