   <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  Only one state court can end a marriage.  If you and your spouse have an open case to end your marriage in another state, and you file a case in Alaska, one of the courts will close their case. 
  To decide  the correct state for your case, the courts will look at:
  
  *	both spouses' "residency" and
  *	which court has the authority, called "jurisdiction", to end the marriage.
  
   <div class="step-subheading">Check if there is residency and jurisdiction in Alaska</div>

  To enter a parenting plan, a child support order, or divide marital property and debt, the court also needs authority called “jurisdiction.”
  Children: Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."
  Spouses: Generally, the court has jurisdiction if a married couple lived in Alaska for at least 6 months in a row within the 6 years before filing for divorce.
  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.”  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  Similarly,

  % if defined('residency_and_jurisdiction') and not residency_and_jurisdiction:
  If the Alaska court has residency and jurisdiction, you can start your case in Alaska, but only one state court can end your marriage.  If you and your spouse disagree about which state, the courts will decide which case to close after hearing both side's arguments.  The decision generally depends on each state's residency and jurisdiction laws.

  If you need information about filling out and filing a Complaint, return to the Guided Assist page and start over.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  
  **Ask the other state to close its case**
  You will have to ask the court in the other stateto close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the Internet to learn about that state's self-help resources and forms.
  **What to expect if you start a case in Alaska**
  Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case.  When this happens, one state court may close its case.
  If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward. 
  It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
  Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  If your spouse has never been to Alaska or no longer lives in Alaska, it is possible he or she will ask the court to dismiss the case.  If the court finds it does not have jurisdiction, it might dismiss your case.  If you have any questions about whether Alaska is the right place for your case, you may want to talk to a lawyer.

  <div class="step-subheading">The benefits of reaching an agreement</div>
  If you and your spouse reach an agreement about the issues in the case, you can avoid a trial.  Some benefits are:
  *
  *
  •	You decide the outcome rather than a judge - you know more about the issues in your case than the judge ever will
  •	If you have children together, working out the parenting plan instead of fighting is better for the children
  •	Reaching an agreement may be more cooperative than dealing with the issues in a trial, where each spouse presents evidence and makes arguments about what they want the judge to decide
  •	Reaching an agreement outside of court can save time and money, and provide more privacy and confidentiality
  
  
  If you want help reaching an agreement before the case is open, some options are:
  
  *
  *
  *
  •	Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial.
  •	Mediation.
  •	Collaborative Law.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk to your spouse about settling the case without a trial</div>
  Some couples want to work out the issues by agreement without a trial and are able to talk to each other in person, on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.  You can use the dissolution and uncontested divorce forms in the next section of this Action Plan to see what you need agree on.
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  Mediation is an informal, voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  *
  *
  *
  *
  *
  •	Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  •	Explain and understand each other's needs.
  •	Clear up misunderstandings.
  •	Explore creative solutions.
  •	Reach acceptable agreements.
  
   Spouses can hire their own private mediators to help resolve any issue in the case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your marriage, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence, and tell your mediator if you want to bring a trusted support person with you.  Read about mediation.
  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  The Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals helps people resolve divorce cases outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.
  
  [Watch a video]
  Watch a short video that discusses resolving your case by reaching agreement with your spouse.  It discusses mediation and settlement conferences which may be available to you using free court programs once you file your case.
  
  [Talk to a lawyer]
  It is a good idea to get legal advice by talking to an attorney about an agreement. Both spouses need to understand how agreeing to each issue affects the other issues in the agreement. If you agree to something without thinking it through, there can be serious and long-standing consequences. Once a judge signs off on your agreement, it will be a binding court order that outlines each spouses’ responsibilities and rights regarding the issues in the case.

  People who have experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they separate from their spouse or start a court case to end the marriage.  During this time, safety is very important.  The dynamics in a relationship with domestic violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they do not want.  If this is your situation, these resources may help:
  
  *	Find a domestic violence program in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with court).
  *	You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find ""Protective Orders.”

  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children, you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children’s best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.
  % if agree_or_settle_kids == 'no':
  <div class="step-subheading">Tell the Judge Your Concerns</div>
  % endif
  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court.  If you have concerns for the children’s safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge.  If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns.  Some options include:
  
  *	no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
  * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
  *	no overnight visitation,
  *	no excessive discipline or spanking,
  *	no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
  *	no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
  *	no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
  *	exchanges only at public or specified places,
  *	supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
  *	parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
  *	supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
  *	no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit, [DR-150**](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-150.pdf) to the other parent:
